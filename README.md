# Self_Driving_Car_Project
The problem seems to be quite complex, and that is truth as well. This project shows solution just to a part of this problem. We will be feeding sequences of images from dashcam and this model will predict the steering angle in degrees.

The link to the dataset is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgjoLe1mm_gLHKzThmksaqH-RpGeD12m/view?usp=sharing The datset contains around 45k images and corresponding steering angles. Its around 2.2 GB and you will be able to train a small model on your pc itself.
